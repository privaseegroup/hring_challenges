# Marketing Role Challenge

For the final round we have a practical task:

Congratulations on getting up to this stage in the interview process.

As our first Marketing Hire at Privasee, your role will be to define a strategy and execute on it. 

Please devise a strategic presentation on your strategy for Privasee to outline the task of increasing Inbound opportunities. 

You can assume a monthly budget of Â£2,000 a month.

Please include:

- Your marketing mix
- What you will handle internally and outsource
- Channels you will use
- how you will communicate (copy)
- who you will target

Please respond to confirm your participation, we aim to make a decision next week shortly after the presentations.
